## **Installation & Setup 🛠️**

### **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivam-pawar-7217/Briefly-News-Summarizer.git  
cd Briefly-News-Summarizer  

```

### **Install Dependencies**

Install the required Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  

```

### **Setup News API or Scraping Mechanism**

You can use a news API (e.g., NewsAPI) or a web scraping library like `BeautifulSoup` for fetching articles.

----------

## **Steps to Run the Project**

### **1. Scrape News Articles**

Use the scraping module to gather articles from different sources:

```python
import requests  
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup  
# Scraping code for news articles  

```

### **2. Process the Articles**

Clean and preprocess the scraped data using NLP techniques.

```python
import nltk  
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize  
# Preprocess the articles  

```

### **3. Generate Summaries**

Use NLP models such as **BERT**, **GPT**, or simpler extractive techniques to generate the summaries.

```python
from transformers import pipeline  
summarizer = pipeline("summarization")  
summary = summarizer(article)  

```

### **4. Display News Summaries**

Use a web framework (e.g., Flask, Django) to present the summarized articles in an attractive UI.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template  
# Render the summarized articles in the UI  

```
